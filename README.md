# Protein Level Predictor for Synthetic Operons ðŸª± ðŸ”¬ ðŸ§ª
This project aims to train a model to determine protein levels in a library of variants of Synthetic operons (consists of 12,900 variants). The algorithm predicts the protein levels for each variant by dividing them into bins. The predictor utilizes a set of features extracted from the operon sequences to make accurate predictions.

## Project Execution Instructions
To successfully execute the code for the protein level predictor, please follow the instructions below:

* Open the file named 'Correlation_and_predictions.m' in MATLAB.
* Inside the folder, you will find the extracted features and a table containing the features for both the known and unknown data. By default, the variable 'create' is set to 0 in the file. If you want to recreate the features tables, change the value of 'create' to 1 instead of 0.
* Press the 'RUN' button in the editor section of MATLAB to execute the code.
* After the code execution, you will have access to two important variables:
'Model_prediction_table': This variable contains the accepted protein levels for all models.
'Final_Result_prediction': This column vector contains the predicted protein levels for the unknown data. The predictions are obtained by choosing the Narrow Neural Network model. Each row in the vector corresponds to a bin, and the order of the bins is the same as specified in the file 'unknown_data_set.xlsx'.

## Loading the Results
To load the results obtained from the protein level predictor, you have two options:

* Open the file 'Final_Result_prediction.mat', which contains a column vector ('Final_Result_prediction') with the predicted protein levels for the unknown data set.
* Load the Excel file named 'Unknown_data_set_w_AverageBinPA_predictions.xlsx'. Column 28 in this file contains the predicted protein levels (AverageBinPA_Prediction), similar to the known_data_set. Please note that the Excel file contains all the features used for the prediction analysis, providing comprehensive information about the predictions.
